# OS-Thread-Scheduler

CMPSC 473 Project 1: Thread scheduling
Description:
Your team will create thread-based schedulers for an n-processor architecture, n > 1, using the following scheduling policies:
1. First Come, First Served (FCFS). 
2. Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), without preemption. 
3. SRTF, with preemption. 
4. Priority Based Scheduling (PBS), with preemption.


##Overview To-Do List
- Implement the already skeletonized "myScheduler" class
- Implement test-bench to self-verify the scehduler
